        Throughout my journey in web development, I’ve contributed to a range of
        projects — from responsive websites for small businesses to advanced
        full-stack applications and complex front-end interfaces. I’ve designed
        custom, high-performance, and scalable solutions while adhering to
        modern development standards.
