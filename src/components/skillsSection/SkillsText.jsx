        Every skill I've developed goes beyond theory, it's tested and proven in
        real-world situations. I work with these tools and languages daily,
        applying professional standards to deliver solid and optimized results.
        My portfolio projects are a direct reflection of this expertise, built
        with passion, precision, and attention to detail.
